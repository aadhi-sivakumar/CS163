# CS163 C++ Assignments  

This repository contains my C++ programming assignments for **CS163** at **Sunset High School**.  

Throughout the course, we implemented a variety of classic data structures and algorithms to strengthen our understanding of computer science fundamentals. The major projects included:  

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – insertion, deletion, search, and traversal operations  
- **Graph Creator** – building and traversing graphs using adjacency structures  
- **Hash Table** – hash functions, collision handling, and efficient lookups  
- **Heap** – priority queue implementation and heap operations  
- **Red-Black Tree** – self-balancing binary search tree with rotations and color properties  
- **Shunting Yard Algorithm** – converting infix expressions to postfix notation and evaluating them  

These assignments gave me hands-on experience with core data structures, algorithm design, and memory management in C++.
